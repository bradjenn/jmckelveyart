      "message":"This was the second time I ordered a custom print from Julia, and I started with high expectations based on my first experience working with her. Julia completely met my expectations! This print is a gift for a Unitarian Universalist minister who loves advanced mathematics. Julia went above and beyond to read about Unitarian Universalism and identify specific math formulas that fit with this faith tradition, and then incorporate them into the design. It was a beautiful and thoughtful piece of work that has gotten an overwhelmingly positive response from many congregation members.",

      "message":"Julia is AMAZING! She worked closely with me to create a personalized work of art that was exactly what I wanted...only I didn't even know what I wanted when I reached out to her. I had a long list of ideas that could maybe, possibly be part of the print. She found a way to pull all of it together into something that looked fantastic. After seeing her initial sketch, I suggested leaving out one element of the design. She thought it would be better with that element, so she did two versions of the print -- one with it, and one without. She was completely right that the print was better with it, and I'm so appreciative of her willingness to put forth some extra effort to make the final piece as good as possible. She helped me to create a very special gift that the recipient loved.",
